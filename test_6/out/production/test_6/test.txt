Belt and Road: 
China and the world

?? Four years ago, China announced its newest development strategy called the Belt and Road, 
and it has been all over the news and social media ever since. This brilliant plan covers a various field, such as trading, 
infrastructure investment, real estate and so on. But today let's take a look at it from just one particular perspective that is the closest to our daily life, 
e-commerce.

As a teenage girl, the first time I truly feel the changes that Belt and Road brought was when I saw a makeup video on Instagram. In the video, 
a girl tried out several kinds of makeup products that were, amazingly, of an original Chinese brand. 
Then I found more videos in which original Chinese products were used. 
I did a little searching and found out that there were quite a lot of Chinese makeup brands that focused not on the domestic market,
 but took the chance and worked only on the overseas market.
